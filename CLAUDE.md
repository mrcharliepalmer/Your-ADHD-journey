# CARE ADHD — Journey Page Redesign

## Context and Intent

This page was built as a speculative piece of work — unsolicited, unrequested — to demonstrate what thoughtful brand and narrative leadership could look like for Care ADHD.

The redesigned page is the argument. It should speak for itself.

Every decision — copy, design, hierarchy, tone — was made as if a CMO who cares deeply about their brand is the first person to see it.

## Project Overview

A speculative redesign of the 'Your Journey With CARE ADHD' page at careadhd.co.uk — demonstrating what thoughtful brand and narrative leadership could look like in practice — keeping the existing brand palette broadly intact while significantly elevating the quality of communication.

This is a single-page HTML/CSS build.

---

## Reference Materials

- **Live page:** https://www.careadhd.co.uk/your-journey-with-us
- **Brand colours:** Broadly teal/blue with soft warm backgrounds, extracted from the live site
- **Copy:** See `CareADHD_Journey_Page_Copy.md` for the full revised page copy
- **Logo:** Text placeholder used in this build

---

## Design Principles

- Warm but not soft — this is a credible healthcare brand, not a wellness app
- Clean hierarchy — the emotional opening lands before any process begins
- Each step should feel distinct but part of a coherent journey
- Generous white space — it is doing as much work as the content
- Mobile responsive throughout
- No clutter, no unnecessary decoration

---

## Page Structure

The page should follow this exact order:

1. **Nav** — minimal, clean, consistent with live site
2. **Emotional opening** — full width, generous spacing, no process yet. This is where we meet the person before we ask anything of them
3. **Numbered steps** — each with a clear heading and body copy. Steps are:
   - Step 1: You've taken the first step
   - Step 2: We'll ask you to help us build a picture
   - Step 3: While you wait — support from day one *(the app — treat as a visual highlight, it is a genuine differentiator)*
   - Step 4: Your assessment — a conversation, not an examination
   - Step 5: Your diagnosis — and what it means
   - Step 6: Treatment — built around you, not a protocol
   - Step 7: What happens after treatment — a sustainable long-term plan *(shared care — calm, clear, reassuring)*
4. **CTA strip** — three options at equal weight: Take the free screener / Sign up for an assessment / Talk to us first

## Technical Notes

- Single HTML file with embedded CSS
- No external dependencies beyond Google Fonts
- Fonts: Lora (serif, headings/emotional moments) + Inter (sans-serif, body) — warm, modern, editorial
- Should feel premium on desktop and clean on mobile
- Extract brand colours from live site CSS where possible

## Tone of Voice

The copy has been carefully written to hold two things in balance — emotional intelligence and practical clarity. Do not rewrite copy. Do not add clinical language. Do not add marketing language.

The person arriving at this page is anxious, uncertain, and possibly relieved for the first time in years. The page should feel like a steady, calm, knowledgeable hand on the shoulder. Not a sales page. Not a brochure. Not a clinical leaflet.

---

## What Success Looks Like

Someone arriving at this page feeling uncertain and anxious should leave feeling informed, reassured, and ready to take the next step.

The process is clear. The support is evident from day one. The long-term picture is honest and reassuring. The tone is human throughout.

If the CMO of Care ADHD sees this and thinks *this is better than what we have, and I want to know who made it* — that's success.
