# Your Journey With CARE ADHD

Most people who find us have already been on a longer journey than they realise.

Maybe it started with a conversation, or something you read, or a moment where someone else's experience sounded uncomfortably familiar. Maybe you've spent years wondering why certain things feel harder for you than they seem to for everyone else. Maybe you've started to think ADHD might explain some of it — and then immediately talked yourself out of it.

That uncertainty is completely normal. In fact it's one of the most common things we hear. You're not self-diagnosing. You're not jumping on a bandwagon. You're trying to understand yourself better. And that's exactly what we're here to help with.

Whatever brought you here, here's what happens next.

## 1. You've taken the first step

You've decided to find out more. That might mean you've come directly to us, or your GP has referred you. Either way, you're in the right place.

Once you sign up, we'll be in touch within 24 hours — usually sooner. From there, we'll guide you through everything. You won't be left wondering what happens next.

## 2. We'll ask you to help us build a picture

Before your assessment, we'll send you a set of questionnaires — about your symptoms, your experiences, and the impact they've had on your life. We'll also ask someone who knows you well, ideally someone who knew you as a child, to share their observations.

We know these forms can feel strange to fill in. You might find yourself second-guessing your answers, wondering whether what you're describing really counts, or worrying that you're not answering the way someone with ADHD would. That's an incredibly common experience — and it's part of why the next step matters so much.

The questionnaires aren't a test you pass or fail. They're a starting point. A way for our clinicians to arrive at your assessment already understanding something of your story.

## 3. While you wait — support from day one

You don't have to wait until your assessment to start feeling supported. As soon as you sign up, you'll have access to the CARE ADHD app — our digital support programme designed specifically for people with ADHD, by a team of ADHD specialists.

The app includes CBT tools, daily exercises, and workbook activities built around the specific challenges ADHD creates — with focus, organisation, stress, and relationships. Think of it as a way of beginning to understand yourself better while you work through the assessment process.

This is what we call our 'waiting well' service. Because the weeks before a diagnosis shouldn't feel like dead time.

## 4. Your assessment — a conversation, not an examination

Your assessment is a virtual appointment, usually lasting 60 to 90 minutes. It'll be just you and your clinician, though you're welcome to bring someone with you if that feels right.

This is where we go deeper. Your clinician will use your questionnaire responses as a starting point — not a verdict — and work through them with you. They'll ask about your childhood, your relationships, your work, your daily life. They'll help you explore whether what you've been experiencing has been there longer than you might have thought, even if it looked different back then.

One thing worth knowing: many people with ADHD became very good at masking their difficulties when they were younger. If your childhood feels like it doesn't quite fit the picture, that doesn't mean you don't have ADHD. It might mean you got very good at coping — and that the cost of that coping is part of what's brought you here.

Our clinicians follow NICE guidelines rigorously, which means a diagnosis is only given when symptoms are persistent, present across more than one area of your life, and not better explained by something else. That rigour is a feature, not a barrier — it means that if you do receive a diagnosis, you can trust it.

## 5. Your diagnosis — and what it means

If you receive a diagnosis of ADHD, you'll get a full written report. But more importantly, we'll help you begin to make sense of what it means for you.

For many people, a diagnosis brings a complicated mix of feelings. Relief. Grief for time lost. Questions about what comes next. All of that is valid, and none of it needs to be resolved immediately.

What it does give you is a framework — a way of understanding yourself that's more useful than the explanations you might have been working with until now.

## 6. Treatment — built around you, not a protocol

Treatment at CARE ADHD combines two things: medication where appropriate, and ongoing psychological support through the app. Neither replaces the other — together, they address both the neurological and the behavioural aspects of ADHD.

**On medication:** we believe in starting low and going slowly. Taking new medication is a significant decision, and we'll make sure you have everything you need to make it thoughtfully. You'll have a medication initiation appointment, followed by reviews at weeks four and twelve — checking what's working, addressing any side effects, and adjusting as needed until you're stabilised on the right dose for you.

**On psychological support:** alongside your medication journey, your CARE ADHD app continues to be a daily resource. You'll also be allocated a personal ADHD coach — available Monday to Friday — for ongoing support and up to three one-to-one appointments to help you build new habits, monitor your progress, and work towards your goals.

## 7. What happens after treatment — a sustainable long-term plan

This is something people often wonder about but rarely ask: *what happens when my private treatment period ends?*

The answer is straightforward. Once you're stabilised, we work with your GP to transition your prescribing to them under a shared care arrangement — so your ongoing medication becomes part of your regular NHS care, at NHS cost. CARE ADHD continues to provide your annual review, making sure everything is still working well for you.

Most GPs are happy to enter into shared care arrangements. In the rare cases where a GP won't, we'll continue to prescribe for you directly. Either way, you won't be left without support.

## Still not sure if ADHD might explain what you're experiencing?

Our free online screening tool is a good place to start. It takes around ten minutes and gives you a clearer sense of whether an assessment might be worth pursuing. There's no obligation, and no wrong answer.
